## ðŸ“Œ About The Project

This Java application simulates a simplified version of the Great Western Trail game, initially designed for single-player mode and later expanded to two-player multiplayer. Multiplayer gameplay is enabled 
through socket-based communication, allowing players to exchange moves in real time. A built-in chat system enhances interaction, and the last move tracking feature provides insights into the 
gameâ€™s progress.
